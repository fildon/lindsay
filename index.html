      <article>
        <p>
          Lindsay was my mother. Lindsay was born in Te Awamutu, New Zealand, to
          Alfred and Fredda Duncalfe. Lindsay was mother to Tracey, Felix and
          Rupert. In 2017 Lindsay died to lung cancer.

          I have aimed to order photos chronologically, name all pictured
          individuals, and include any written text on the back of each photo in
          the description. I have likely made some mistakes. Let me know if you
          can help me fill in blanks, or make corrections. Get in touch with me
          via email at maxfmckay@gmail.com
