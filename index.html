        <p>
          This project was initiated by me, Rupert Foggo McKay, while archiving
          a box of family photos belonging to my mother, Lindsay Meller. It aims
          to document and preserve these photos for the benefit of all friends
          and family. Feel free to share this webpage with anyone it may be of
          interest to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have aimed to order photos chronologically, name all pictured
          individuals, and include any written text on the back of each photo in
          the description. I have likely made some mistakes. Let me know if you
          can help me fill in blanks, or make corrections. Additionally I will
          respect any requests to take a photo down, if you have reason to
          believe a particular picture ought to remain private. Get in touch
          with me via email at
          <a href="mailto:maxfmckay@gmail.com">maxfmckay@gmail.com</a>.

          This letter was sent from Fredda in Te Awamutu, New Zealand to Lindsay
          in Devon, England on 28th January 1982. My mother kept this letter for
          over 20 years; until her death. I have kept it for nearly 20 more.
          Inside is a letter four pages long. It would violate their privacy to
          transcribe it here. But I will share that it begins: "Dear Lins". And
          ends: "Love ma."
